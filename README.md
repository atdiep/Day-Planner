# Day-Planner

This is a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. The app displays a normal 9AM to 5PM job, and each row represents one hour time slot that consists of the current time (in hours), an event input box and a save button. In addition, each hour will change in colors depends on the current hour of the day to signify the events are in the past, the present, or the future. This app will run in the browser and was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.
